                <h2>About David</h2>
                <p id="squish">I have experience in leadership, public speaking, social media, content marketing, and e-commerce. However, I'm quite flexible and can learn anything along the journey even without someone looking over my shoulder. I'm not a sensitive or cynical person, can take criticism and work well with people. This is why I'm excited to always learn more programming! It's such an amazing way to create!
                Aside from coding I did martial arts for around 8 years and I've been skiing in the rocky mountains since I was 5. Growing up in Colorado has been amazing but don't come here because we have enough people already haha. I have two older sisters, two little niences and two lovely parents that immigrated here from Russia. Yes I do speak fluent Russian but my writing & reading skills are sadly elementry.</p>
